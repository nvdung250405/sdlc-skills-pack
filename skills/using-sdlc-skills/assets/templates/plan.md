# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE_NAME]

> **Document type:** Canonical Artifact Contract  
> **Artifact:** Technical Implementation Plan  
> **Primary Owner Skill:** `spec-driven-development`, `planning-and-task-breakdown`  
> **Canonical Destination Path:** `docs/features/<feature-id>/plan.md`  
> **Status:** `<Draft | In Review | Approved>`  
> **Last updated:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>`  

- **Feature ID:** `FEAT-NNN`
- **Spec / SRS Reference:** `docs/features/<feature-id>/spec.md`
- **Plan Author:** [Role / Team / Agent]

---

## 1. Goal, Scope & Context (Required)
[State the intended engineering outcome, affected codebase areas, and core architectural constraints. Reference existing contracts and schemas.]

---

## 2. Key Architecture Seams & Decisions (Required)
- **Component Seams:** [Which modules, boundaries, or contracts are modified?]
- **Interface & Schema Contracts:** [OpenAPI, GraphQL, or database migrations needed]
- **ADR References:** [Link to relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/`]

---

## 3. Technical Strategy & Slicing (Required)
Explain the vertical slicing strategy. Work must be delivered in thin, independently verifiable increments.

- **Slice 1:** [Foundation / Contract / Data migration]
- **Slice 2:** [Core business logic & domain handling]
- **Slice 3:** [UI surface / Consumer integration]

---

## 4. Verification & Testing Strategy (Required)
| Level | Scope / Target | Framework / Tool | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Domain logic, entities | Jest / Pytest | 100% pass, covers edge branches |
| Integration | DB adapters, API routes | Supertest / Testcontainers | DB transactions & wire schemas valid |
| E2E / Browser | Critical user flow | Playwright | AC Given/When/Then scenarios green |

---

## 5. Dependencies, Risks & Rollback Plan (Required)
- **Dependencies:** [External services, library upgrades, migrations]
- **Technical Risks & Mitigations:** [Potential regressions and preventive measures]
- **Rollback Strategy:** [Feature flag disable, database down-migration procedure]

---

## 6. Readiness Gate & Sign-off (Required)
- [ ] Scope and acceptance criteria from feature spec are fully mapped
- [ ] Vertical slices are testable and ordered without circular dependencies
- [ ] Contract-first design established before persistence changes
- [ ] Testing strategy includes automated verification commands
- [ ] Rollback strategy is realistic and documented
- **Approved by:** [Tech Lead / Date]
